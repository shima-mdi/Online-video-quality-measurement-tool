QualityPulse is an innovative interface designed to monitor video quality in real time, inspired by the way an electrocardiogram visualizes heart activity. The system evaluates video quality on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest quality.
The model is trained using the VMAF quality metric and bitstream features (e.g., quantization parameter) extracted from H.264 videos. Users can upload videos in the .m3u8 format or evaluate live streaming videos directly from Channel 3 of Iranian Broadcasting TV.
This interface simplifies quality evaluation, particularly for streaming applications, by providing a visual and intuitive representation of video performance
